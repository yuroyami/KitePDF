## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Custom font embedding in the writer: TrueType (`glyf`) and OpenType/CFF (`.otf`)
  programs are embedded as composite Type0 fonts (Identity-H) with a generated
  `/ToUnicode` map, so emitted text round-trips back to Unicode through the reader.
- From-scratch font subsetting for both formats, keeping only the glyphs a
  document actually draws:
  - TrueType subsetter with `glyf`/`loca` renumbering, a rebuilt SFNT, and a
    `/CIDToGIDMap` stream.
  - CFF subsetter that rewrites the CFF INDEX/DICT/charset/FDSelect structures
    and emits a bare `CIDFontType0C` `/FontFile3`.
  - Subset `/BaseFont` names carry the standard six-letter subset tag.

### Changed

- Continuous integration now builds and tests the JVM target on every push and
  pull request, with `mupdf-tools` installed so the differential oracle tests
  run against `mutool` in CI.

### Fixed

- Oracle tests that previously printed a message and returned early (reported as
  passing) when `mutool` or a test font was absent now use JUnit assumptions, so
  they report as skipped instead of silently green. No real assertion was weakened.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

- Initial public release, published to Maven Central under
  `io.github.yuroyami:kitepdf`.
- Pure-Kotlin PDF engine for Kotlin Multiplatform: parser, renderer, writer,
  editor, encryption, and font handling, callable from `commonMain` and running
  unchanged across Android, iOS, JVM, JS, Wasm, and Kotlin/Native.
