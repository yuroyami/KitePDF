# Changelog

All notable changes to KitePDF are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- EPUB support: a second document handler, `:kitepdf-epub`, built on the shared
  core and proving the multi-format architecture.
  - Pure-Kotlin reflowable EPUB 2/3 reader: container/OPF parsing, metadata,
    table of contents, and pagination to fixed page sizes.
  - CSS engine: cascade with user-agent, author, and reader origins, selector
    matching including pseudo-classes and sibling combinators, and
    `::before`/`::after` generated content.
  - Box-model layout: block and inline flow, margins/borders/padding, tables,
    `float`/`clear` with exclusion bands, inline images on the baseline, and
    `position: relative`.
  - Typography: per-glyph font fallback, embedded fonts (TrueType,
    OpenType/CFF, WOFF), Unicode bidirectional text, Knuth-Liang hyphenation
    with bundled TeX patterns for English, German, French, Spanish, Italian,
    Portuguese, and Dutch, CJK inter-character justification with kinsoku
    line-break rules, ruby annotations, `text-transform`, letter and word
    spacing, and synthesized small-caps.
  - Structured text extraction and search over laid-out pages; anchors,
    internal links, and href-to-page navigation.
  - Reader settings (`EpubSettings`): font family, line-height scale, text and
    background colors, forced justification, and a publisher-CSS toggle,
    applied as a dedicated cascade origin that overrides author `!important`.
- Module taxonomy: the single `:kitepdf` module is split MuPDF-style into
  `:kitepdf-core` (format-agnostic substrate: geometry, canvas, fonts, images,
  compression, text) and `:kitepdf-pdf` (the PDF handler), joined by
  `:kitepdf-epub`; the renderers are renamed to `:kitepdf-skia-renderer` and
  `:kitepdf-compose-viewer`, and `:kitepdf` remains as an umbrella artifact
  that pulls in everything.
- Pure-Kotlin image codecs in the core: PNG (decoder and encoder), JPEG, GIF,
  and JBIG2, replacing platform-specific decode paths so images render
  identically on every target.
- Robustness hardening against hostile documents: a 512 MiB decompression
  bomb guard across the Flate/LZW/RunLength filters and the PNG, EPUB-zip, and
  WOFF inflate sites, plus content-stream operation budgets (5 million parsed
  operators per stream, 20 million dispatched per page), so crafted inputs
  degrade to truncated output instead of exhausting memory or CPU.
- Custom font embedding in the writer: TrueType (`glyf`) and OpenType/CFF (`.otf`)
  programs are embedded as composite Type0 fonts (Identity-H) with a generated
  `/ToUnicode` map, so emitted text round-trips back to Unicode through the reader.
- From-scratch font subsetting for both formats, keeping only the glyphs a
  document actually draws:
  - TrueType subsetter with `glyf`/`loca` renumbering, a rebuilt SFNT, and a
    `/CIDToGIDMap` stream.
  - CFF subsetter that rewrites the CFF INDEX/DICT/charset/FDSelect structures
    and emits a bare `CIDFontType0C` `/FontFile3`.
  - Subset `/BaseFont` names carry the standard six-letter subset tag.

### Changed

- The renderer seam is format-neutral: `Canvas.drawText` is replaced by
  `Canvas.drawGlyphs`, which takes positioned glyph runs instead of
  PDF-specific text state, so non-PDF handlers drive the same canvas.
- Continuous integration now builds and tests the JVM target on every push and
  pull request, with `mupdf-tools` installed so the differential oracle tests
  run against `mutool` in CI.

### Fixed

- Trust-critical PDF fixes: encryption key authentication, explicit
  wrong-password signalling instead of garbage output, and a redaction leak
  where removed content could survive in the written file.
- Render correctness: page rotation, origin, and crop-box handling; image
  decode fixes; parser error recovery; embedded-glyph advances unified to
  1/1000 em; the default shading-fill path now paints unclipped `sh`
  operations instead of dropping them.
- Font subsystem hardening: CFF Type2 charstring edge cases, CJK CMap
  codespace ranges, and embedded CMap streams.
- EPUB pagination now compiles and runs on non-JVM targets: a JVM-only
  `putIfAbsent` call was replaced with the multiplatform `getOrPut`.
- Oracle tests that previously printed a message and returned early (reported as
  passing) when `mutool` or a test font was absent now use JUnit assumptions, so
  they report as skipped instead of silently green. No real assertion was weakened.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

- Initial public release, published to Maven Central under
  `io.github.yuroyami:kitepdf`.
- Pure-Kotlin PDF engine for Kotlin Multiplatform: parser, renderer, writer,
  editor, encryption, and font handling, callable from `commonMain` and running
  unchanged across Android, iOS, JVM, JS, Wasm, and Kotlin/Native.
